## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **XAMPP** (or equivalent like Laragon, WAMP, Docker with PHP/MySQL)
    * PHP 8.4.x
    * MySQL Database
* **Composer** (PHP dependency manager)
* **Node.js & npm** (for frontend asset compilation, primarily for planned Tailwind/Livewire)
* **Git**

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/roshaneranga/FuelManagementSystem.git](https://github.com/roshaneranga/FuelManagementSystem.git)
    cd FuelManagementSystem
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment File:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Generate Application Key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Configure Database:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and update your database credentials:
    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=fuel_management_db # You can choose any name
    DB_USERNAME=root               # Your MySQL username (e.g., root for XAMPP)
    DB_PASSWORD=                   # Your MySQL password (empty for XAMPP root by default)
    ```
    Make sure to create the `fuel_management_db` database in your MySQL (e.g., via phpMyAdmin) before running migrations.

6.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    This will create the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
    *If you encounter issues and want to reset your database, use `php artisan migrate:fresh` (this will delete all data).*

7.  **Seed Database (Optional):**
    If you have seeders (e.g., for test data), you can run them:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

8.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

9.  **Compile Frontend Assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # For development
    # or npm run build # For production
    ```

10. **Start the Laravel Development Server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
